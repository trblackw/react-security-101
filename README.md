## I just want to learn more about security 🕵🏻‍♂️

I've been writing React for over 2 years now, both in my side projects and at work.
In that time I've learned quite a bit about not only React, but building scalable
applications with authenticated users, and role-based navigation systems. But my
architecture for these applications has varied widely. I've been wanting to refine
my authentication flow and come up with a more consistent way of doing things, and
with that desire has come my realization that there are a lot of gaps in my knowledge
when it comes to security and the web.

I found an excellent series by Ryan Chenkie titled [Advanced React Security Patterns](https://reactsecurity.io/advanced-react-security-patterns/),
which then led me to the prerequisite course, [React Security Fundamentals](https://courses.reactsecurity.io/courses/react-security-fundamentals/).
I want this repo to serve as a means for me to centralize all that I learn in these courses,
to hold myself accountable to completing the series, as well as to learn in public.
